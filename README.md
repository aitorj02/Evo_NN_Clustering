# Evo_NN_Clustering

## Overview
Welcome to the Evo_NN_Clustering project! In this exciting journey, we tackle the clustering problem by exploring the space of neural networks that predict centroids based on a given set of points. Our focus is on evaluating the accuracy of neural network architectures generated by a neuro-evolutionary algorithm for clustering problems in 2D, specifically in terms of the mean distance between each point and its nearest centroid.

## Project Structure
In this project, you'll find five key directories, each serving a distinct purpose:

1. **code**: 
   - This directory contains all the source code essential for the project. From the implementation of the neuro-evolutionary algorithm to the neural network architectures, every piece of code you need to understand and run the project is here.

2. **datasets**: 
   - Here, you'll find the datasets used for training and testing our neural networks. These datasets consist of various 2D points that our algorithms will attempt to cluster effectively.

3. **models**: 
   - This directory houses the saved models generated throughout the project. Each model represents a unique neural network architecture that has been evolved and trained to solve the clustering problem.

4. **notebooks**: 
   - In the notebooks directory, you will find Jupyter notebooks that provide a step-by-step walkthrough of our experiments, visualizations, and detailed explanations of our methodology. These notebooks are designed to make it easy to follow our thought process and replicate our results.

5. **references**: 
   - To support our work, we have compiled a collection of references including research papers, articles, and other resources that have inspired and guided our project. This directory is a treasure trove of knowledge for those looking to dive deeper into the theory and background of neuro-evolution and clustering.

We hope this structured approach makes it easy for you to navigate through the project and understand the different components that come together to make Evo_NN_Clustering a success. Let's dive in and explore the fascinating intersection of neural networks and clustering!
