Evo_NN_Clustering
Treatment of the clustering problem as a search in the space of neural-networks that predict the centroids given a set of points. We investigate the accuracy of the neural network architectures generated by a neuro-evolutionary algorithm for clustering problems in 2d in terms of the mean distance between each point and its nearest centroid.
